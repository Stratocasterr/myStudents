## About project 

This app is for private lessons' teachers, to keep information about their students in comfortable and clear way. Here one is able to add students with the most important information about each ( salary per single lesson, lessons times, school he/she goes or pending payment ) to database. Teacher is able to see statistic data about his/her group (and about each single student) like total salary or lessons amount per week or total pending payment. What is more, one is able to modify each students infos if it is needed. My app also has light/dark theme switcher, so one may adjust it to his/her preferences. Web app is also prepared to display it on mobile devices.
